/*
Atlassian's Bitbucket service provides free git and mercurial source code repository hosting. One way to represent the history of a source code repository 
like git is as a graph of commits. Some examples:A simple linear commit graph. This is the graph of a repository with no branching or merging
A-B-C-D
The graph of the history of a repository with a single branch. The repository was branched at Commit B. Commits E and F were made against this branch
    E-F
   /
A-B-C-D
The graph of the history of a repository with a single branch which is then later merged back into master. The repository was branched at Commit B. 
Commits E and F were made against this branch. Commit G resulted from merging commits F and D
    E-F
   /   \
A-B-C-D-G
Implement a function that will find the most recent common ancestor of any two commits from a given commit graph. The commit graph is represented as a 
String[] called commits containing all commit IDs in sorted date order (most recent first) and a String[][] called parents. The parent IDs for the commit 
ID at index i can be found at parents[i]. The last item in the parents array is always null since this represents the parent of the root commit. For 
example, the following commit graph:
    E-F
   /   \
A-B-C-D-G

will be represented using:
String[] commits = {"G", "F", "E", "D", "C", "B", "A"};
String[][] parents ={{"F","D"},{"E"}, {"B"}, {"C"}, {"B"}, {"A"}, null}; 
If one commit is an ancestor of the other, return the commit that is the ancestor
Your implementation must implement the FindCommonAncestor interface.
Sample input:
String[] commits = {"G", "F", "E", "D", "C", "B", "A"};
String[][] parents ={{"F","D"},{"E"}, {"B"}, {"C"}, {"B"}, {"A"}, null}; 
String commit1 = "D";
String commit2 = "F";
This is asking for the most recent common ancestor of commits D and F in the following commit graph
    E-F
   /   \
A-B-C-D-G
The answer is B
